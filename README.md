This is the GitHub repo for https://FoundationEvent.com.  It advertises the upcoming events on the floor.

# How to maintain the events
- Update any date/time info (with day of the week)
    - Write the _fancy_ date & time in the `<h3>` tag
    - Write the **ugly** date & time format in the `<countdownDate>` tag
- Update the event's info.
- Put the poster in the empty `<img>` tag
- Forms for registration can be embedded on the proper page

# Adding a new event
- Use the [Event Template.html](<Event Template.html>) and copy it, and rename it to whatever the event will be.
    - Edit the default details in the file.
    - Name, Date, Time, Details, etc...
- Create a new folder in the [Assets](Assets/) folder for the event's images.
